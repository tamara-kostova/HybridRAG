-- Extract entities, relationships, and properties from the text related to Alzheimer's research and CT scans.
-- Structure your output for knowledge graph construction as follows:

-- Instructions

-- 1. Nodes:
--    - Label nodes as Person, Organization, Publication, Concept, Condition, Event, Institution, or University.
--    - For consistent labeling, use broad labels only (e.g., "Person" instead of "scientist") and the fullest identifier for repeated entities (e.g., "John Doe" rather than variations).

-- 2. Relationships:
--    - Use REFERENCES, CITED_BY, AUTHORED_BY, ASSOCIATED_WITH, PART_OF, EXPLAINS, DESCRIBES, or TREATED_WITH.
--    - Limit custom relationships to maintain simplicity and consistency.

-- 3. Properties:
--    - Add a single `text` property per node with relevant phrases from the text.

-- Output Format

-- - Nodes: `<NodeID, Label, "text">`
-- - Relationships: `<NodeID1, RELATIONSHIP_TYPE, NodeID2>`

-- Tokens:  
-- - Nodes: `[[START_NODES]]` / `[[STOP_NODES]]`  
-- - Relationships: `[[START_RELATIONSHIPS]]` / `[[STOP_RELATIONSHIPS]]`

-- Example

-- Input: “Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-beta plaques…”

-- Output:
-- [[START_NODES]]
-- <"AD", "Concept", "Neurodegenerative disorder associated with cognitive decline.">
-- ...
-- [[STOP_NODES]]

-- [[START_RELATIONSHIPS]]
-- <"AD", "ASSOCIATED_WITH", "Amyloid_Plaques">
-- ...
-- [[STOP_RELATIONSHIPS]]
