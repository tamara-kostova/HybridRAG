-- Extract entities, relationships, and properties from the text related to Alzheimer's research and CT scans. 
-- Structure your output for knowledge graph construction as follows:

-- Instructions

-- 1. Nodes:
--    - Label nodes as Person, Organization, Publication, Concept, Condition, Event, Institution, or University, then ID them with a NodeID which is descriptive of the node itself. 
--    - For consistent labeling, use broad labels only (e.g., "Person" instead of "scientist") and the fullest identifier for repeated entities (e.g., "John Doe" rather than variations).
      - Make sure to ALWAYS ID Alzheimer's Disease as "Alzheimer’s Disease" whenever you see it. It is central to my graph and needs to be named consistently to avoid graph fragmentation. 
-- 2. Relationships:
--    - Use labels such as REFERENCES, CITED_BY, AUTHORED_BY, ASSOCIATED_WITH, PART_OF, EXPLAINS, DESCRIBES, or TREATED_WITH to label relationships.
      - Provide a brief description of the relationship which can be reasonably inferred from the text. 
--    - Limit custom relationships to maintain simplicity and consistency.

-- 3. Properties:
--    - Add a single `text` property per node with relevant phrases from the text. Make sure the text property is concise and descriptive of the Node.
--    - Add a single 'description' property per relationship with a relevant description of the the relationship between two nodes.  

-- Output Format

-- - Nodes: `<NodeID, Label, "text">`
-- - Relationships: `<NodeID1, RELATIONSHIP_TYPE, "description" ,NodeID2>`

-- Tokens:  
-- - Nodes: `[[START_NODES]]` / `[[STOP_NODES]]`  
-- - Relationships: `[[START_RELATIONSHIPS]]` / `[[STOP_RELATIONSHIPS]]`

-- Example

-- Input: “Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-beta plaques…”

-- Output:
-- [[START_NODES]]
-- <"Alzheimer's Disease", "Concept", "Neurodegenerative disorder associated with cognitive decline.">
-- <"Amyloid-beta plaques", "Concept", "extracellular deposits of amyloid beta protein that present mainly in the grey matter of the brain">
-- ...
-- [[STOP_NODES]]

-- [[START_RELATIONSHIPS]]
-- <"Alzheimer's Disease", "ASSOCIATED_WITH", "the dysregulation of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) level leads to the appearance of senile plaques which contain Aβ depositions, which increases risk of Alzheimer's Disease", "Amyloid-beta plaques">
-- ...
-- [[STOP_RELATIONSHIPS]]
